                    Hey there! My name is Victor Corvalan and I'm a videogame developer with many years making games (2000's) and a lot of experience developing native mobile APPS for Android and iOS. Currently working at <a href="https://roshkastudios.com">Roshka Studios</a> developing, designing and 
                    producing hypercasual/hybridcasual mobile games.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Here you will find my personal projects, where my focus is to create the games that I want without necessary looking at trends, different from what we do at Roshka Studios.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In other words, welcome to my playground!.
                </p>
