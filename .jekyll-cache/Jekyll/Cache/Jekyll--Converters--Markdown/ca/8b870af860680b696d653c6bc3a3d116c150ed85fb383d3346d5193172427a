I"Ú<p><strong>We have 3 projects planning to release this year, the first of them is a â€œliving storybookâ€ for kids to be finished on August 30th.</strong></p>

<p>The Toonminator is â€œre-startingâ€. It was started by Victor Corvalan and then with the musician Ronny Antares many years ago. Years has passed and we gain experience during the shutdown of this project. We are ready and recharged with cool ideas that we need to bring to life.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s have fun!</p>
